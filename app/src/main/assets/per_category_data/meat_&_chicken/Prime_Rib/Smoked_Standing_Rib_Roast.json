    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Start at least 10 pounds of the charcoal in a torpedo style smoker. You need a fairly hot fire. Fill the secondary pan with cold water, and wait for the coals to turn white. Soak hickory chips in bourbon with enough water to cover. Rub the roast liberally with steak seasoning, being sure to coat all surfaces."
        },
        {
            "2": "When the coals are ready, place the roast on the top grate. Throw a few handfuls of soaked hickory chips onto the fire, and close the lid. Check the fire every 45 minutes or so, adding more charcoal as needed to keep the fire hot. Every time you check the fire, add more wood chips. Cook for 8 to 10 hours, or to your desired doneness. Use a meat thermometer to check the roast. The meat tastes best when rare: 145 degrees F (65 degrees C), but cook to your liking."
