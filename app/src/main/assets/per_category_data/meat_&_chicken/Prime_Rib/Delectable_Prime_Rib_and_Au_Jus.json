If you prefer the meat well-done, roast an additional 45 minutes. Remove roast from oven, and allow to stand while you make the sauce. Temperature of the meat will rise about 10 more degrees as it rests."

Bring the mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring often, until the sauce reduces by half, 20 to 30 minutes. Strain sauce and discard vegetables before serving sauce with the roast."
