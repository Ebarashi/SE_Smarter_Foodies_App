Place the roast, bones facing down, in the middle of the batter in the pan. Pull the batter up and around the roast to completely cover the meat. Pat on extra batter if necessary. Insert meat thermometer into the roast with its gauge positioned to be visible from the front of the oven (or use a regular meat thermometer)."
