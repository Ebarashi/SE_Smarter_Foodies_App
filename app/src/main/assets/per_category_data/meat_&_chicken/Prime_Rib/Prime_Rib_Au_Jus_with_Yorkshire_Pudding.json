    "Ingredients": [
        {
            "1": "1 (5 pound) bone-in beef rib roast"
        },
        {
            "2": "8 cloves garlic, quartered"
        },
        {
            "3": "0.75 teaspoon salt"
        },
        {
            "4": "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
        },
        {
            "5": "2 cups eggs"
        },
        {
            "6": "2 cups milk"
        },
        {
            "7": "1 pinch salt"
        },
        {
            "8": "2 cups all-purpose flour"
        },
        {
            "9": "0.5 cup pan drippings from prime rib"
        },
        {
            "10": "0.5 cup white wine"
        },
        {
            "11": "2 cups beef stock"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Place the roast bone-side down in a roasting pan, and use a sharp paring knife to poke 24 small holes 1 inch deep all over the roast. Stuff each hole with a sliver of garlic. Sprinkle with 3/4 teaspoon salt, and LOTS of black pepper. Allow the roast to stand at room temperature for 2 hours. This will take the chill off and allow the meat to cook more evenly."
        },
        {
            "2": "Meanwhile, beat together the eggs and milk with a pinch of salt until smooth. Stir in flour until smooth. Cover the Yorkshire pudding batter, and place in the refrigerator."
        },
        {
            "3": "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C)."
        },
        {
            "4": "Cook the roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the meat reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 1 hour."
        },
        {
            "5": "When the roast is done, remove it from the roasting pan, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest in a warm spot while you make the Yorkshire pudding. Measure out 1/2 cup of the beef fat, and divide among 12 muffin tins; pour off the remaining fat, but save the roasting pan to make the jus."
        },
        {
            "6": "Place the grease-filled muffin tins into the oven, and turn the temperature up to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Let the muffin tins preheat for 10 minutes, then fill 3/4 full with the refrigerated batter, and return to the oven. Bake 20 to 25 minutes until the puddings have risen tall and are golden brown."
        },
        {
            "7": "While the Yorkshire puddings are baking, place the roasting pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Stir in the wine, and bring to a simmer while scraping to dissolve the pan drippings; pour in the beef stock and return to a simmer. Cook 10 minutes, then strain and serve with the roast and puddings."
