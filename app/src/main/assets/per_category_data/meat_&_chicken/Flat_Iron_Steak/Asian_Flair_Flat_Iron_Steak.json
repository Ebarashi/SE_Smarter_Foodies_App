            "1": "Whisk together 2 tablespoons of sesame oil with the garlic, salt, onion powder, Cajun seasoning, hot pepper sauce, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and brown sugar in a bowl, then pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the flat iron steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 12 hours."

            "2": "Remove the flat iron steak from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of sesame oil in a cast iron skillet over medium high heat until it begins to smoke. Sear the steak in the hot oil until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium. Remove the steak from the skillet and set aside to rest for 5 minutes before slicing thinly. While the steak is resting, cook the bell pepper in the hot skillet until it begins to soften, about 1 minute. Stir in the green onions, and cook for 30 seconds more. Serve the pepper mixture over the sliced steak."
