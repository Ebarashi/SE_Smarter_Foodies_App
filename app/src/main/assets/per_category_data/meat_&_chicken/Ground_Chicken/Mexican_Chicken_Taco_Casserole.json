    "Directions": [

            "1": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray and set aside."

        {
            "2": "Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add ground chicken and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally to break up the meat, until onion is mostly tender and meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Season with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt. Add black beans, corn, tomatoes, and tomato sauce; stir until well combined."

        {
            "3": "Bring mixture to a low simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. Taste mixture and adjust the seasonings as desired."

            "4": "Spoon a couple of good-sized scoops of meat mixture onto the bottom of the prepared casserole dish, and spread into a thin layer. Lay about half of the tortillas over the sauce, breaking them in half as needed to make a fairly even layer without too much overlap. Add remaining meat mixture over the tortilla layer. Top with remaining tortillas, again breaking into pieces as necessary to evenly cover the surface."

        {
            "5": "Cover with shredded cheese. Spray a piece of foil with nonstick cooking spray, and set the sprayed side against the cheese to cover the casserole dish (this helps prevent cheese loss when you remove the foil)."
        },
        {
            "6": "Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbly and cheese is nicely melted, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting into wedges or scooping out to serve."
