    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Rinse brisket thoroughly in cool water and place into a large Dutch oven. Generously coat beef with brown sugar on all sides. Pour Irish stout beer around roast, followed by beef stock. Liquid should cover brisket by about 1 inch; add another beer if more liquid is needed."

        {
            "2": "Place onion, garlic, bay leaves, spike packet from corned beef, and peppercorns into liquid. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover Dutch oven.

Add cabbage wedges and simmer until tender, about 10 more minutes. Brisket should easily pull apart with your fingers or a fork."
