        {
            "1": "1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup"
        },
        {
            "2": "1 large egg"
        },
        {
            "3": "1 seasoning salt to taste"
        },
        {
            "4": "4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves"
        },
        {
            "5": "0.5 cup all-purpose flour"
        },
        {
            "6": "0.5 cup cornstarch"
        },
        {
            "7": "0.5 teaspoon garlic powder"
        },
        {
            "8": "0.5 teaspoon paprika"

        {
            "9": "1 salt and pepper to taste"
        },
        {
            "10": "1 oil for frying"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Combine condensed soup, egg, and seasoning salt (be careful, as soup is already salted) in a shallow dish or bowl; mix well. Dip chicken in mixture and turn to coat completely. Set aside."
        },
        {
            "2": "Mix together flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken pieces, one at a time, in the bag, seal and shake to coat. Add more flour and cornstarch as necessary, but add them in equal parts."
        },
        {
            "3": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Be sure to use enough oil to cover chicken pieces."
        },
        {
            "4": "Place coated chicken on a platter; allow to sit until outside becomes doughy (this is critical to ensure crispiness when fried). Once chicken coating is doughy, test oil by dropping a piece of coating into it; oil is ready if it starts to fry immediately."

        {
            "5": "Working in batches, fry chicken pieces in hot oil until cooked through and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve."
