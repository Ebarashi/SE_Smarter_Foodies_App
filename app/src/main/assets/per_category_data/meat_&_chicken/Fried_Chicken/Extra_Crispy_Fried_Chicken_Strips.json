        {
            "1": "Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Mix eggs and water together in a small bowl."

        {
            "2": "Place some chicken strips in the flour mixture to coat, then gently shake to remove any excess flour. Coat strips in egg. Return to the flour mixture and coat again; repeat with egg mixture. Coat once more in the flour mixture, placing strips on a plate while you continue with remaining chicken."

            "4": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); oil is ready if you drop some water in and it sizzles."

            "5": "Working in batches if needed, place strips in the hot oil. Cook for 8 minutes. Turn over and continue to cook until golden brown, no longer pink in the centers, and juices run clear, about 8 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place strips on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess grease."
