    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a large, oven-proof skillet in the oven as it preheats."

        {
            "2": "Bring steaks to room temperature. Rub with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper."

For medium doneness, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a warm platter and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes; the steaks will continue to cook during this process and the internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees."

            "6": "Meanwhile, heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic and saute until shallot is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in cream; let cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Turn heat to low and add Gorgonzola cheese. Let cheese melt; season with salt and pepper. Serve sauce with steaks."
