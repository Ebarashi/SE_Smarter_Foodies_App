        {
            "1": "Whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, honey, garlic powder, ground ginger, green onion, and vegetable oil in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the flank steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours."

            "2": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate."

            "4": "Cook the flank steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm, and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Once cooked, cover the steak with several sheets of aluminum foil, and set aside to rest for 10 minutes before slicing thinly against the grain."

        {
            "5": "While the steak is resting, bring the marinade to a boil over medium-high heat. Pour the sauce over the sliced steak to serve."
