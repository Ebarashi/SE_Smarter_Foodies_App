Tear off 2 more sheets of foil and place them on top of the spare ribs, shiny-side up. Begin tightly folding the edges of the foil together to create a sealed packet. Just before sealing completely, divide beer mixture evenly into each packet. Complete the seal. Place the packets side-by-side on an 11x14-inch baking sheet."
