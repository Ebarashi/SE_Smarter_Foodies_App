            "2": "Pat filets mignons dry and season with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot, but not smoking. Brown filets on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer filets to an oiled baking pan and roast in the middle of the preheated oven until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Top each filet with the crabmeat and butter mixture."
