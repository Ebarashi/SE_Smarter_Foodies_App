        {
            "1": "0.25 pound pie crust pastry"
        },
        {
            "2": "7 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
        },
        {
            "3": "3 tablespoons ground almonds"
        },
        {
            "4": "0.25 teaspoon baking powder"
        },
        {
            "5": "2 tablespoons strawberry jam"
        },
        {
            "6": "1 large egg"
        },
        {
            "7": "0.25 teaspoon lemon zest"
        },
        {
            "8": "0.25 cup butter"
        },
        {
            "9": "0.25 cup superfine sugar"
        },
        {
            "10": "1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar (Optional)"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch pie plate."
        },
        {
            "2": "Roll pastry into a round shape a little larger than the pie plate. Cut off a 1/2-inch wide strip from the edge of the pastry circle, and line the lower sides of the pie plate with the strip, placing the cut side upwards; the pastry will not reach the rim of the pie plate. Dampen the strip with water, then place the remaining pie pastry circle into the pie plate, pressing to seal the edges of the circle onto the strip where the pastry overlaps. This will create a crust that is slightly thicker around the lower edges."

        {
            "3": "Whisk flour, ground almonds, and baking powder together in a medium bowl. Whisk egg and lemon zest together in a small bowl."
        },
        {
            "4": "Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually add egg mixture, beating well after each addition. Gently fold in flour mixture, a spoonful at a time, until just incorporated."

        {
            "5": "Spread strawberry jam evenly over the center of the pastry shell, then spread batter over top."

            "7": "Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar just before serving."
