In a separate pan, saute mushrooms in 3 tablespoons of butter, then stir into the saucepan. Stir in chicken, carrot, celery and potatoes; continue to cook until potatoes and carrot are slightly softened, 5 to 7 minutes more. Mix well and pour into bottom pie crust. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape."
