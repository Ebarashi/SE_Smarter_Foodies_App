With a pastry cutter, chop the vegetable shortening and unsalted butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with a few pea-sized pieces of fat; stir in ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, just until the mixture holds together when squeezed. Divide dough in half, and form each half into a ball; wrap the balls in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to overnight."

Pour the filling into the crust-lined pie dish. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of butter pieces over the filling. Roll the second dough ball out into a 10-inch circle on a floured surface, and gently place the top crust onto the filling. Crimp the edges together with a fork to seal. Brush the pie with beaten egg white, and cut several slits into the top crust with a sharp knife.."
