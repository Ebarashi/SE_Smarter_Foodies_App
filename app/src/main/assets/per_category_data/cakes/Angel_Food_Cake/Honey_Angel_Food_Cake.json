            "2": "Beat egg whites with salt in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Add cream of tartar and continue to beat until egg whites stand in peaks. Gradually add honey while beating continually to integrate until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks."
