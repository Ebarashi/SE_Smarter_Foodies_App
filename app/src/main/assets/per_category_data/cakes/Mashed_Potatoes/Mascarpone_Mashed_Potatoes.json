            "4": "0.75 cup milk"
        },
        {

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Place potato halves into a large pot of salted water, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until very tender, about 15 minutes. A knife should pierce the middle of a potato half easily. Transfer potatoes to a colander and drain thoroughly, about 5 minutes."

        {
            "2": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)."

        {
            "4": "Transfer potatoes to a separate large mixing bowl, add butter chunks to potatoes, and season with salt and black pepper. Mash butter into potatoes with a potato masher until fluffy; a few lumps are okay. Whisk mascarpone mixture into mashed potatoes."
        },
        {
            "5": "Spread mashed potatoes into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Smooth the top and use the tip of a spatula to lightly press the potatoes and lift up to create little peaks and valleys in the top."
        },
        {
            "6": "Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are heated through and top is golden brown, about 20 minutes."
