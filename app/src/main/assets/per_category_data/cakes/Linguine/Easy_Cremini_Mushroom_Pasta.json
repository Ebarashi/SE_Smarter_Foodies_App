        {

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving about 1 cup pasta water to thin out sauce later if necessary."
        },
        {
            "2": "Meanwhile, heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute mushrooms, onion, and garlic in the hot butter until soft, about 5 minutes. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat while stirring. Add flour, stirring constantly, to smooth out any lumps. Season with salt and pepper and continue to stir. Stir in cream; add cheese and nutmeg. Keep stirring; turn heat down to medium-low. Let simmer until thickened, stirring every 5 minutes to prevent lumps and sticking; you may need to turn heat down to low and add more butter."

        {
            "3": "Mix in the cooked pasta and add splashes of reserved pasta water as needed to reach desired sauce consistency."
