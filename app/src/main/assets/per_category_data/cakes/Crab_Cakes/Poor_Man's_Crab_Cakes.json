            "1": "Split and mash the potatoes in a mixing bowl; set aside. The potato skins may be left on if desired."

        {
            "2": "Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the bell pepper, onion, and celery in the melted butter until they begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir the milk into the mixture; pour the mixture over the mashed potatoes and stir to combine. The consistency should not be too runny. Allow the mixture to cool completely."

Do not flip until bottom is fully browned and crisp; this ensures the patties will not break. Transfer to a baking dish in the oven to keep hot until all are cooked. Serve hot."
