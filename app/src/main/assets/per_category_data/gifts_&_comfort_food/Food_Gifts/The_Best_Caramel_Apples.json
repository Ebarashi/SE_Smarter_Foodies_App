        {
            "1": "8 large tart apples"
        },
        {
            "2": "8  wooden chopsticks for handles"
        },
        {
            "3": "2 cups packed brown sugar"
        },
        {
            "4": "1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk"
        },
        {
            "5": "1 cup light corn syrup"
        },
        {
            "6": "1 cup butter"
        },
        {
            "7": "2 teaspoons vanilla extract"
        }

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Dip apples in boiling water for a few seconds, using a slotted spoon, then dry with paper towels to remove any wax from the peels. Set apples aside to cool completely, about 30 minutes."
        },
        {
            "2": "Insert sticks into the bottom of each cooled apple through the core for a handle."
        },
        {
            "3": "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
        },
        {
            "4": "Stir brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup, and butter together in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to medium. Cook until a candy thermometer reads 248 degrees F (120 degrees C), stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 25 to 30 minutes. A teaspoon of caramel dropped in a glass of cold water, should form a firm ball. Remove caramel from heat and stir in vanilla extract."
        },
        {
            "5": "Working quickly, dip each apple into the hot caramel to completely coat the apple and about 1/2 inch of the wooden handle. Sprinkle apples with any desired toppings while still hot. Let caramel apples cool on the prepared baking sheet, about 1 hour. Use caution, caramel is very hot."
