Divide dough in half and shape each half into a rectangle about 12 inches long and 1/2 inch thick. Starting at the long ends, tightly roll dough to form two skinny loaves. Slightly flatten the tops. Transfer loaves to a prepared baking sheet and dust with flour. Cover with a light, dry towel and let rise until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours."
