            "2": "Roll 1 package of pizza dough out into a 10-inch square on a lightly floured surface using a lightly floured rolling pin, using hands to pull corners. Cut square in half using a pizza wheel or sharp knife, then cut each half into 15 strips about 2/3 inch wide. Dust dough lightly with flour if necessary to prevent sticking. Gently tie each strip into a knot, pulling ends slightly to secure. Arrange knots 1 inch apart on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough."
