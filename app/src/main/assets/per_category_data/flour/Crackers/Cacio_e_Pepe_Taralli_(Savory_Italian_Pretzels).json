        {
            "1": "1 cup all-purpose flour"
        },
        {
            "2": "2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper"
        },
        {
            "3": "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
        },
        {
            "4": "0.25 cup white wine"

        {
            "5": "2 tablespoons olive oil"
        },
        {
            "6": "0.5 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Combine flour, pepper, and salt in a mixing bowl, and stir with a spoon to combine. Pour in wine and olive oil. Mix until dough starts to come together. Knead by hand until dough is smooth and slightly elastic, about 3 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes."
        },
        {
            "2": "Unwrap dough and cut into 4 pieces. Roll each piece out with your palms into ropes about 10 to 12 inches long. Cut each rope into 3 pieces; roll each piece to a length of 5 or 6 inches. Twist the ends a few times and press them together to form a ring, twisting as needed to fully seal the ends."
        },
        {
            "3": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat (such as SILPAT\u00ae)."
        },
        {
            "4": "Bring a pan of water (at least 3 inches) to a boil. Drop in 4 rings of dough at a time. Boil until rings float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon onto a towel-lined plate. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet."
        },
        {
            "5": "Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over each ring; flip and grate more cheese on the other side. Flip back to the first side and apply one last grating of cheese, or until rings are thoroughly coated."
        },
        {
            "6": "Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and crunchy, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the baking sheet onto a wire rack and let cool completely before serving."
