            "1": "2 cups 2% reduced fat milk"
        },
        {
            "2": "1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast"
        },
        {
            "3": "0.5 tablespoons white sugar"

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Warm the milk in a small saucepan to no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Sprinkle the yeast overtop and let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes; stir in the sugar."
        },
        {
            "2": "Whisk the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oatmeal, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour the milk mixture into the well. Stir until the dough has pulled together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes."
        },
        {
            "3": "Lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes."
        },
        {
            "4": "Grease 2 8x4-inch loaf pans. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly-floured surface. Use a knife to divide the dough into two equal pieces - don't tear it. Shape into dough rounds and let rest for 10 minutes. Form the dough into loaves and place into the prepared pans. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes."
        },
        {
            "5": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)."
        },
        {
            "6": "Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely."
