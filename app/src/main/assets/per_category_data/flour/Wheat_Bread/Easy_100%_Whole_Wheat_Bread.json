            "4": "Meanwhile, prepare a 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper. Flour a surface to work the dough."

        {
            "8": "Bake in the preheated oven until top of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes before removing from the pan and transferring to a wire rack. Let cool an additional hour before slicing; otherwise it will feel doughy."
