Grate cold butter into the flour mixture, tossing every so often to coat it with flour so it doesn't start to clump. When all butter has been added, work it into the flour with a pastry blender. Add grated white chocolate and toss with a fork to incorporate."

            "10": "Transfer dough to a generously floured work surface and without kneading, push and pack it together with your hands until it holds its shape, adding a little flour if it's too sticky. Press dough into a rectangle, about \u00be-inch thick, and roughly twice as long as it is wide."

        {
            "11": "Sprinkle dried raspberries evenly over the dough. Spread berries out almost to the edges and press them into the dough gently. Using a bench scraper, lift one third of the dough from one of the shorter edges and fold it in over the center third; press it down and square off the edges. Repeat with the other side so your scone dough is three layers thick."
