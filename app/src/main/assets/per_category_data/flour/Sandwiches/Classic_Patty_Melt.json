            "1": "Season ground beef with salt and pepper; divide into 3 equal-sized balls. Shape each ball as close as possible to the shape of the bread. Make an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to help keep them flat while cooking."

Cook bread until golden brown and cheese has started to melt, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip each sandwich over and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes."
