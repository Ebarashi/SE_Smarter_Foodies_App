Add onions, garlic, and a big pinch of salt; saute until onions turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce, 1 1/4 cup chicken broth, chili powder, oregano, pepper, more salt, cayenne, cumin, and cinnamon; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Add more chicken broth for a thinner sauce if desired. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed. Keep warm until needed."

Whisk the whites into soft peaks and use a spatula to fold the whites into the yolk mixture. You don't have to be too gentle, but the batter should end up light and foamy."
