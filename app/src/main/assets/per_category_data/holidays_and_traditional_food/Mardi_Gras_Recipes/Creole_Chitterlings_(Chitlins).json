        {
            "3": "Cut the chitterlings into 1 inch pieces and return to the pot. Pour out most of the cooking liquid. Discard the potato, onions, celery and bay leaf. Heat the chitterlings through and serve with your favorite side dishes. Store the leftovers in the refrigerator. Like so many other great soul food dishes, chitlins taste even better after the flavor has soaked in for a few hours."
