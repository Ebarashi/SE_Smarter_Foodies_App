        {
            "1": "1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta"
        },
        {
            "2": "0.25 cup butter"
        },
        {
            "3": "2 cloves garlic, minced"
        },
        {
            "4": "2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry"
        },
        {
            "5": "3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil"
        },
        {
            "6": "2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
        },
        {
            "7": "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"
        },
        {
            "8": "1 salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
        },
        {
            "9": "0.5 cup heavy cream (Optional)"
        },
        {
            "10": "1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese to taste (Optional)"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook, uncovered, for 4 to 5 minutes or until al dente; drain."
        },
        {
            "2": "While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Slice any scallops over 3/4-inch thick in half so they'll cook evenly; stir scallops, basil, and parsley into the skillet. Cook and gently stir just until scallops feel slightly firm when pressed with a finger, about 2 to 3 minutes. Scallops will become tough and chewy if overcooked."
        },
        {
            "3": "Reduce heat to low; stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Pour in cream if you like a thicker sauce and cook just until the sauce begins to simmer."

        {
            "4": "Ladle scallops and sauce over hot pasta and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top."
