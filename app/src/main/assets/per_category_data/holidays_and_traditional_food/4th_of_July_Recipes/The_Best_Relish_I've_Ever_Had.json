    "Directions": [
        {

            "4": "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack relish into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with the lids; screw on the rings."

Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process the jars for 10 minutes."

            "6": "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place them onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (the lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area."
