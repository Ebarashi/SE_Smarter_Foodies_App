Lightly mix the ground beef, sausage, 1 tablespoon sweet chile sauce, five-spice powder, garlic powder, green onion, and salt and pepper. Place about 1 teaspoonful of the meat mixture onto a wonton wrapper with one corner facing you. Fold in the left and right corners of the wrapper to slightly overlap the filling, then tightly roll the lower corner up to create a pocket around the filling. Continue rolling until just the tip of the remaining corner is visible; brush the corner with the egg white mixture to seal."
