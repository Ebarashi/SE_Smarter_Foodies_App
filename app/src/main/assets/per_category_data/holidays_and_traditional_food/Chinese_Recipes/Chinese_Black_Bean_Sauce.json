            "1": "8 ounces dried fermented black beans"
        },
        {
            "2": "0.5 cups vegetable oil"
        },
        {
            "3": "4  Thai chiles, chopped"

        },
        {
            "5": "1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated"
        },
        {
            "6": "3 cloves garlic, minced"
        },
        {
            "7": "3 tablespoons reduced-sodium tamari"
        },
        {
            "8": "2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine"
        },
        {
            "9": "1 teaspoon brown sugar"
        },
        {
            "10": "0.5 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper"
        },
        {
            "11": "0.5 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder"
        },
        {
            "12": "1 teaspoon sesame oil"

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Rinse black beans thoroughly and dry. Remove about 1/4 cup and set aside. Roughly chop the rest of the beans."
        },
        {
            "2": "Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add chiles, shallot, ginger, and garlic. Fry until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Do not let the ingredients burn. Reduce the heat if necessary. The objective is to slow cook the ingredients."
        },
        {
            "3": "Add all the beans; both chopped and whole. Simmer, stirring often, until the beans are soft, about 2 minutes. Add tamari, rice wine, brown sugar, ground Sichuan pepper, and five spice. Simmer until thickened, stirring often. Remove from heat; let cool, about 10 minutes."
        },
        {
            "4": "Mix in sesame oil and cover. As the sauce rests, the beans will settle and the oil will float, creating a barrier which will protect it from mold. The sauce is ready to use or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month."
