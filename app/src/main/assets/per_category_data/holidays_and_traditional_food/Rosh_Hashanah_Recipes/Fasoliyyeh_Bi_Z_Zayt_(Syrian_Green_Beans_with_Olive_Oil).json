            "1": "1 (16 ounce) package frozen cut green beans"
        },
        {
            "2": "0.25 cup extra virgin olive oil"
        },
        {
            "3": "1 salt to taste"

        {
            "4": "1 clove garlic, minced"
        },
        {
            "5": "0.25 cup chopped fresh cilantro"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Place the green beans into a large pot, and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt to taste, and put the lid on the pot. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until beans are cooked to your desired doneness. Syrians like it cooked until the green beans are turning brownish in color. The idea is not to saute them, but to let them steam in the moisture released by the ice crystals."

            "2": "Add cilantro and garlic to the beans, and continue to cook just until the cilantro has started to wilt. Eat as a main course by scooping up with warm pita bread or serve as a side dish."
