        {
            "1": "Inspect 5 quart-sized jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until peaches are ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water."

            "6": "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes to seal, or consult times recommended by your local extension."
        },
        {
            "7": "Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area."
