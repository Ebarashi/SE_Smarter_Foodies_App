            "2": "Meanwhile, combine pears, water, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in pectin, and bring to a full boil.

        {
            "5": "Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area."
