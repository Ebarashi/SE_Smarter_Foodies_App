Spread rice evenly onto nori sheet, leaving about a 1/2 inch uncovered at the bottom. Arrange cucumber and avocado across the center of the rice. Lift the mat, roll over vegetables once, and press down. Unroll, then roll again towards the uncovered end of the nori to make a long roll. Seal roll with a little water if necessary. Repeat to make remaining rolls."
