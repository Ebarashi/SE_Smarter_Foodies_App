        {
            "1": "Combine cranberries, orange juice, water, cinnamon stick, and vanilla extract in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot\u00ae). Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 1 minute. Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build. As soon as the cooking cycle finishes, turn the Instant Pot\u00ae off, as overcooking the cranberries will cause the skins to break."

            "3": "Turn Instant Pot\u00ae back on and select Saute function. Stir white sugar and brown sugar into cranberry mixture until sugar melts. Season with a pinch of salt. As soon as sugar has melted, turn off the Instant Pot\u00ae to avoid overcooking. Taste cranberry sauce and stir in more sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, depending on how sweet you like your cranberry sauce."

            "4": "Transfer sauce to a serving dish and top with orange peel. Serve warm or cold. Cranberry sauce will thicken as it cools."
