            "2": "Pour off most of the fat from the pan, leaving about 2 to 3 tablespoons. Return pan to medium-low heat and add flour. Using a whisk, stir vigorously until roux forms, scraping bottom of pan. Reduce heat to low and let roux cook at least 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Grandma always burned hers a little on purpose."

Bring gravy to a boil and cook to desired thickness. Add more milk if a thinner gravy is desired. You may also add some of the cooked and crumbled sausage to the gravy."
