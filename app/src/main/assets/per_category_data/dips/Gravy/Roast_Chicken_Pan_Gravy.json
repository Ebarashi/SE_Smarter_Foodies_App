    "Ingredients": [
        {
            "1": "0.25 cup drippings from a roast chicken"
        },
        {
            "2": "1.0 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
        },
        {
            "3": "2 cups cold chicken stock, or more if needed"
        },
        {
            "4": "1 salt and ground black pepper to taste"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Pour fat from drippings into a bowl and reserve. Whisk flour into remaining drippings left in pan; mixture will seem dry. Add 2 tablespoons reserved fat, or as needed, to the drippings mixture to combine with flour."
        },
        {
            "2": "Place the pan with drippings mixture over low heat and toast flour until light brown and mixture gives off a nutty fragrance, about 5 minutes."
        },
        {
            "3": "Drizzle about 1/3 cup cold chicken stock at a time into pan drippings, whisking each addition of stock into mixture until thoroughly combined. Continue whisking, scraping any browned pan drippings from the bottom of the pan into gravy; bring to a simmer. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until gravy is thick and flour has combined with the liquid, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. For the smoothest texture, strain gravy before serving."
