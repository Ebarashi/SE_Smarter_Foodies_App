Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings."

Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for about 15 minutes."
