            "1": "2 tablespoons butter"

        {
            "2": "1  onion, finely chopped"
        },
        {
            "3": "1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth"
        },
        {
            "4": "1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes"
        },
        {
            "5": "1  orange, juiced"
        },
        {
            "6": "1  orange, juiced and zested"

            "7": "3 tablespoons sour cream"

        {
            "8": "1 salt and pepper to taste"

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Melt butter in a large saucepan or soup pot over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, and stir in the butternut squash cubes, orange juice, and orange zest. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until the squash cubes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes."
        },
        {
            "2": "Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour back into the pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Whisk in sour cream until smooth, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat over medium-low heat until almost simmering, and serve hot."
