    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking pan with parchment paper or a nonstick silicone baking mat."

            "2": "Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in vegan butter and coconut oil with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs."

            "3": "Slowly stir in cold almond milk, adding just enough for a wet and sticky dough to come together."
        },
        {
            "4": "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead (fold over) 15 times. Gently roll or pat dough to a thickness of 1 to 1 1/2 inches. Cut biscuits with a small biscuit cutter or a small bourbon glass. Gently re-roll dough scraps and cut remaining biscuits for a total of 12."

        {
            "5": "Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet so they are touching each other. Don't be afraid to squish them together as this helps them to rise even higher."

        {
            "6": "Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes."
