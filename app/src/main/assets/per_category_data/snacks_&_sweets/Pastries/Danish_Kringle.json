    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Sift flour into a large bowl; cut in 1 cup of butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly, leaving pea-sized chunks. Stir in sour cream and mix well to form a sticky dough. Cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight."
        },
        {
            "2": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease or line a baking sheet. Prepare the filling by mixing 1 cup softened butter, brown sugar, and 1 cup chopped walnuts in a bowl until well combined; set aside."

        {
            "3": "Divide dough into three equal parts; return two parts to the refrigerator to keep cold. Quickly form 1/3 of the dough into a rectangle, and flour lightly. On a heavily floured surface, roll out to approximately 12x17 inches. Position lengthwise on the work surface. Along the long edges of the dough rectangle, use a sharp knife to cut 4-inch long angled lines about 1/2 inch apart. Spoon 1/3 of the filling along the length of the rectangle's uncut center. Alternating from one side of the dough to the other, fold each 1/2 inch wide strip towards the center, crisscrossing the filling in a braid-like fashion. Lightly press together the ends of the strips to seal. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the remaining walnuts. Repeat with remaining ingredients to form 3 braids. Arrange braids on the prepared baking sheet."

            "4": "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for approximately 30 minutes. While the pastries are cooling, prepare the icing: Mix confectioners sugar and water together until smooth and thin enough to drizzle; spoon or drizzle over cooled pastries."
