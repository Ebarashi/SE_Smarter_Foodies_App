        {
            "1": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
        },
        {
            "2": "Unroll the dough of 1 cinnamon roll and cut in half. Roll 1 of the halves to form the body. Rotate the roll so the outer end of the roll is facing downward. This will form the bunny's front legs. Cut off 1/3 of the remaining dough and roll it up to form the tail. Roll up the last 2/3 of the dough to about the halfway point to form the head. Slice through the remaining unrolled portion and fan out the pieces to form the ears."

        {
            "3": "To attach the tail and head to the body, rub away any cinnamon coating, wet the dough, and press the pieces together. Spread out the ears and pinch them at the tips to shape. Repeat with remaining rolls."

            "4": "Transfer the bunnies to the prepared baking sheet by carefully lifting with a spatula or scraper."

            "5": "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Slide parchment paper with bunnies onto a rack to cool slightly."

        {
            "6": "Spread the glaze onto the warm bunnies, following the pattern of the swirls and ears. Press a raisin in the the center of the swirl on the head to form the eyes."
