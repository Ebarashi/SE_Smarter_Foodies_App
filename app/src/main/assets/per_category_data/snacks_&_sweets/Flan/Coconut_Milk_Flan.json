        },
        {
            "2": "0.75 cup whole milk"
        },
        {
            "3": "1 cup coconut milk"

            "4": "0.5 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk"

        {
            "5": "0.5 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk"

            "6": "0.5 teaspoon vanilla extract"

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 6 (4-ounce) ramekins."
        },
        {
            "2": "Slowly melt sugar in a large skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until browned but not scorched, about 8 minutes. Divide caramel equally among the ramekins and allow to cool."
        },
        {
            "3": "Combine whole milk, coconut milk, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract in a saucepan over low heat. Stir continuously until it begins to steam, about 5 minutes."
        },
        {
            "4": "Whisk 3 eggs together in a bowl; slowly pour beaten eggs into the warm milk mixture, whisking constantly until the custard is combined."
        },
        {
            "5": "Place ramekins in a casserole dish and fill with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Divide custard evenly among ramekins, over the caramel sauce, about 1/2 inch from the top. Cover casserole dish tightly with foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the custard is set, about 1 hour. A knife gently inserted into the center of a flan should come out clean."
        },
        {
            "6": "Remove ramekins from the water bath and allow to cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours before serving to chill completely. Run the tip of a paring knife around the edges to release the flan. Place a plate over the top of the ramekin and flip to release the flan onto the plate, caramel side up."
