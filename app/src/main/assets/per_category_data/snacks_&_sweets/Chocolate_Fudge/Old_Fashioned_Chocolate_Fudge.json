    "Ingredients": [
        {
            "1": "2 cups white sugar"
        },
        {
            "2": "0.5 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
        },
        {
            "3": "1 cup whole milk"
        },
        {
            "4": "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced and softened"
        },
        {
            "5": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
        }

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Grease an 8-inch square baking pan."
        },
        {
            "2": "Place sugar and cocoa powder in a medium saucepan; pour in milk and stir until blended. Set heat to medium-high and stir constantly until mixture comes to a boil."
        },
        {
            "3": "Reduce heat to low and place a candy thermometer in the pan. Let the mixture simmer without stirring until the temperature reaches 238 degrees F (114 degrees C) when measured with a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes. If you don't have a candy thermometer, drop a small amount of the mixture into cold water; if it forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface, it's ready."
        },
        {
            "4": "Remove from the heat. Allow to cool to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C), 50 to 70 minutes. Do not disturb fudge as it's cooling."

        {
            "5": "Add butter and vanilla to the fudge. Beat with a wooden spoon until well incorporated and fudge loses its sheen; do not under beat."
        },
        {
            "6": "Pour fudge into prepared pan and press to flatten. Let cool at room temperature or in the refrigerator before cutting into 1-inch squares."
