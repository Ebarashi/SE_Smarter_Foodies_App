        {
            "1": "4 cups fresh figs, stems removed"
        },
        {
            "2": "3 cups white sugar"

        {
            "4": "5  half-pint canning jars with lids and rings, or as needed"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Mix figs and sugar together in a large saucepan, place over medium heat, and cook, stirring often, until sugar has dissolved. Mix in strawberry gelatin; bring the mixture to a boil and boil for 7 minutes. Mash preserves with a potato masher if desired."
        },
        {
            "2": "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the fig preserves into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings."

        {
            "3": "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes."
        },
        {
            "4": "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area."
