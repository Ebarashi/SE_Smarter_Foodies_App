        {
            "1": "8  half pint canning jars with lids and rings"
        },
        {
            "2": "0.5 cups cider vinegar"
        },
        {
            "3": "3.0 cups white sugar"
        },
        {
            "4": "1 cup shredded carrot"
        },
        {
            "5": "0.5 cup minced red bell pepper"
        },
        {
            "6": "15  habanero peppers, seeded and minced"
        },
        {
            "7": "2 (3 ounce) pouches liquid pectin"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Stir the vinegar and sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat until the sugar has dissolved, then stir in the carrot and red bell pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and simmer 5 minutes. Add the habanero peppers and simmer 5 minutes longer. Pour in the pectin, and boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Skim and discard any foam from the jelly."
        },
        {
            "2": "Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pour the jelly into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings."
        },
        {
            "3": "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 5 minutes."
        },
        {
            "4": "Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all)."
