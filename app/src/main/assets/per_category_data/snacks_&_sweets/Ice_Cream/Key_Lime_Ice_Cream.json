    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, sugar, lime juice, and lemon zest in a saucepan over medium heat until well blended. Continually stir egg mixture with a wooden spoon until thickened, 7 to 8 minutes. It should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. Remove from heat, and stir in half and half until smooth. Strain mixture through a fine sieve set over a clean bowl. Cover and chill the mixture in the refrigerator, occasionally stirring, until cool, about 1 hour."

            "2": "Pour chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's directions until it reaches soft-serve consistency. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight."
