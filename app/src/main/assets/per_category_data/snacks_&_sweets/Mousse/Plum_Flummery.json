            "1": "Place the plums into a saucepan over medium-low heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the plums are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. If the mixture becomes too thick or starts to burn, add a tablespoon of water. Remove from heat, and allow to cool."

Whip the evaporated milk in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until thick, then gently spoon the whipped milk into the plum mixture. Beat again with electric mixer until the dessert is fluffy and well combined. Chill for at least 3 hours before serving."
