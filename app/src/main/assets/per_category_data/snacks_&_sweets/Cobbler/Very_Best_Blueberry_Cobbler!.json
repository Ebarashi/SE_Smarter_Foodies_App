        {
            "1": "1.0 cups fresh or frozen blueberries"
        },
        {
            "2": "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
        },
        {
            "3": "0.5  lemon, juiced"

            "6": "1 tablespoon butter, melted"

            "8": "4 teaspoons baking powder"
        },
        {
            "9": "6 tablespoons white sugar"
        },
        {
            "10": "5 tablespoons butter"
        },
        {
            "11": "1 cup milk"
        },
        {
            "12": "2 teaspoons sugar"
        },
        {
            "13": "1 pinch ground cinnamon"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Lightly grease an 8 inch square baking dish. Place the blueberries into the baking dish, and mix with vanilla and lemon juice. Sprinkle with 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of flour, then stir in the tablespoon of melted butter. Set aside."
        },
        {
            "2": "In a medium bowl, stir together 1 3/4 cups of flour, baking powder, and 6 tablespoons sugar. Rub in the 5 tablespoons butter using your fingers, or cut in with a pastry blender until it is in small pieces. Make a well in the center, and quickly stir in the milk. Mix just until moistened. You should have a very thick batter, or very wet dough. You may need to add a splash more milk. Cover, and let batter rest for 10 minutes."
        },
        {
            "3": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spoon the batter over the blueberries, leaving only a few small holes for the berries to peek through. Mix together the cinnamon and 2 teaspoons sugar; sprinkle over the top."
        },
        {
            "4": "Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden brown. A knife inserted into the topping should come out clean - of course there will be blueberry syrup on the knife. Let cool until just warm before serving. This can store in the refrigerator for 2 days."
