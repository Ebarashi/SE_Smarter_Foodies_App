            "2": "If you don't have a mortar and pestle, you can make a version of this in your blender or food processor: coarsely chop the garlic, chile peppers, and green beans. Mix in the papaya, and pulse a few times. Mix in the tomato, fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar. Pulse to combine; salad should still have texture. Transfer to a serving dish and stir in the peanuts."
