Boil for 5 minutes before closing the pressure valve. Bring to a pressure of 10 psi, then reduce the heat in order to maintain this pressure. Process for 75 minutes, watching the gauge closely so the pressure stays at 10 psi. After 75 minutes, turn off the heat and allow the canner to cool until the gauge reads 0 psi."
