            "6": "1 cup wheat germ"
        },
        {
            "7": "2 cups shredded coconut"
        },
        {
            "8": "1 cup unsalted sunflower seeds"

        {
            "9": "1 cup canola oil"
        },
        {
            "10": "0.5 cups honey"
        },
        {
            "11": "1 cup raisins"
        },
        {
            "12": "1 cup dried cranberries"
        }

    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)."
        },
        {
            "2": "In a large bowl, stir together the oats, almonds, walnuts, pecans, sesame seeds, wheat germ, coconut and sunflower seeds. In a small pan over medium heat, stir together the oil and honey. Cook and stir until blended. You could also do this in a large measuring cup in the microwave, heating for about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Pour over the oat mixture, and stir to coat evenly. Spread out in an even layer on two cookie sheets."
        },
        {
            "3": "Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the oats and nuts are toasted. Immediately after it comes out of the oven, stir in the raisins and dried cranberries. Let stand until cooled, and stir again to break up any large clusters. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks, but I guarantee it won't be around that long!"
