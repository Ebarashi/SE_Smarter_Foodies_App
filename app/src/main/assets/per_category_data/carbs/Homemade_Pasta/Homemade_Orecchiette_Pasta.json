    "Ingredients": [
        {
            "1": "1.0 cups durum wheat semolina flour (such as Bob's Red Mill\u00ae)"
        },
        {
            "2": "1 pinch salt"
        },
        {
            "3": "1 cup water, or as needed, at room temperature"
        }
    ],
    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Mix semolina flour and salt in a large bowl or on a marble work surface. Make a well in the center."
        },
        {
            "2": "Pour water into the well a little at a time, mixing it with the flour. Add as much water as needed to make a sticky but compact dough."
        },
        {
            "3": "Knead dough with your hands by flattening the ball, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is elastic and smooth, but not too soft, about 10 minutes."
        },
        {
            "4": "Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes before using."
        },
        {
            "5": "Work with one portion of dough at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered to keep it from drying out. Dust a work surface with semolina flour; roll out the dough to make a rope, about 1/3 inch thick."
        },
        {
            "6": "Cut off little 1/3-inch thick pieces. Pick up knife with a rounded tip. Carefully hold one side of the dough with your index finger. Hold the knife in your other hand. Gently drag the small piece of dough towards you. Lift up the knife by the end in such a way that you get a thicker edge. You'll obtain a small disk of dough, thinner in the centre. Press the disk gently against your thumb and it will curve."
        },
        {
            "7": "Proceed the same way with the rest of the dough. Transfer orecchiette onto a floured surface and sprinkle with more semolina flour. Do not overlap orecchiette or they will stick together. Let dry for about 30 minutes before cooking."
