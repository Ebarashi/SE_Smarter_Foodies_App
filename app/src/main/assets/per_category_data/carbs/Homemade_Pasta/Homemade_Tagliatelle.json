            "1": "Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in eggs; add salt. Gently beat eggs using a fork, incorporating the surrounding flour, until mixture is runny. Pull remaining flour into the center using a bench scraper, incorporating it until dough forms a ball."
        },
        {
            "2": "Knead dough with your hands by flattening the ball, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes."

            "3": "Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour."

            "4": "Divide the dough into 3 equal portions. Flatten the first portion and pass through the thickest setting of the pasta machine. Dust with more flour, fold in half like a book and repeat 3 to 4 times, flouring, folding, and passing through the thickest setting,until the dough is smooth in texture, even in size, and no longer sticky."
        },
        {
            "5": "Move the pasta machine to a middle setting and pass each sheet through once. Move to the next-to-last setting and pass through once. Cut in half. Repeat with remaining 2 portions."
        },
        {
            "6": "Add the tagliatelle attachment to the pasta machine and pass each piece through. Roll the machine handle with one hand and collect the pasta with the other."
        },
        {
            "7": "Gently toss pasta with some more flour. Air dry for 30 minutes."
        },
        {
            "8": "Cook tagliatelle in plenty of salted, boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes."
