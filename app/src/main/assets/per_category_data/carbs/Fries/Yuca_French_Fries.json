            "1": "Place the yuca into a large pot, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the yuca can be pierced easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain, and allow to steam for several minutes until cool enough to handle. Cut the yuca into french fry-sized sticks, discarding the fibrous core."
