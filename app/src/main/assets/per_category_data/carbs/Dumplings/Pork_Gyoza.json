Fold wrappers in half over filling, creating a semi circle. Take one side of the wrapper and make crimps along the edges for a decorative pattern (like pleats of a skirt) and press along the edges to seal the two sides together. Ensure there isn't much excess air caught inside the dumpling. Repeat until all the pork mixture is used."
