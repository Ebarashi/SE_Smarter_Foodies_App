    "Directions": [
        {
            "1": "Lay a wrapper on a work surface diagonally, so it resembles a diamond. Place a slice of green chile horizontally across wrapper, 1 inch above the bottom point. Lay a strip of Monterey Jack cheese on top of chile."

            "2": "Dip an index finger into a small bowl of water and moisten the wrapper edges. Roll wrapper up and over chile and cheese, starting from the point closest to you. Bring in both sides, making sure to press firmly to seal filling. Continue rolling away from you to enclose filling. Repeat with remaining wrappers, chiles, and cheese."
