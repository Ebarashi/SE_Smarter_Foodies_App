            "5": "6 cloves garlic, minced"
        },
        {
            "6": "1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained"
        },
        {
            "7": "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar"
        },

            "8": "1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth, or as needed"

        {

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir vinegar into mushroom sauce. Pour mushroom sauce over tenderloins, letting sauce seep between the two tenderloins."

Remove 1/4 cup of the fat from the mixture and pour into a saucepan. Add enough chicken broth to the drippings to make 2 cups; whisk flour into drippings until incorporated. Stir broth-drippings mixture into the saucepan with fat over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper."
